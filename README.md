# Practice Applications

This is a collection of small applets/games and studies of data structures & algorithms in each of these three languages: Java, C++, Python.
- Java: Calculator, Login System, Drawing App, Snake Game, Recursion Practice, DS&A studies.
- C++: Tic-Tac-Toe Game, Custom Text Editor w/ Qt framework.
- Python: Clock, Animated GUI, Custom Text Editor.

## Goals

- This is a running repository that will continue receiving commits as I further explore different aspects of programming.
- I intend to develop more small GUI applications as well as dive deeper into searching/sorting algorithms.

## Outcomes  

The only outcome of this repository is that I learn something with each project. So far, the current outcomes have included understanding the Qt framework better with C++, how to use the Python's tkinter library to build GUI apps, as well as deeper exploration into searching/sorting algorithms in Java.
